For the c++ program, it is a simple code that will display the output of "Hello World!" as an introductory message to the language.

For the per program, i used how to send an email using perl, simply just run the code, input the email you want to use and to whom is directed, followed by creating a subject, then typing out the message you want the email to contain.

For the python program, i've copied a program that uses arthimetic addition operator to add two numbers. Input the numbers you want to be added, then run the program. The output should be the sum of both numbers.

For the ruby code, i copied a code that will find the missing number in an arthimetic sequence such as #(2,4,6,10). The input should be the sequence with the missing number. The output will be the missing number in the sequence.
